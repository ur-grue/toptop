## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Signal delivery now reports a precise outcome** — *delivered*, *permission
  denied* (e.g. signalling another user's process without `sudo`), *already
  exited*, or *unsupported* — instead of a single generic "Failed to signal".
  The failure reason is read from the real `kill(2)` errno. (#20)
- **Signal-menu labels:** the confirmation prompt and status line now name all
  nine signals correctly; `SIGQUIT`, `SIGUSR1`, and `SIGUSR2` were previously
  mislabeled as `SIGTERM` or shown as a bare "signal". (#20)
- **Signal numbers** shown in the menu are now platform-correct on macOS
  (e.g. `SIGSTOP 17`, `SIGUSR1 30`) instead of hardcoded Linux values. (#20)
- The process table no longer refreshes while a kill confirmation is open, so
  the selected target can't vanish between prompt and confirm. (#20)

### Changed

- Battery is polled at most once every 10s instead of on every refresh tick,
  removing repeated `/sys` filesystem I/O from the hot path. (#20)
- A process's executable path and working directory are resolved on demand for
  the selected row only, rather than allocated for every process on every
  refresh. (#20)
- Internal: signal name and number now derive from a single authoritative
  `SIGNALS` table. (#21)

### Documentation

- Recolored the AI-view hero graphic to the default `gruvbox` theme so it
  matches what users see on first launch. (#24)
- Documented the signal-menu permission-denied behavior. (#23)
- Added macOS to the platform badge. (#25)
- Bumped the tests badge to 68. (#22)

### Changed
